# Base WordPress theme

## Import concepts

- [WP CLI `dotenv` command](https://github.com/aaemnnosttv/wp-cli-dotenv-command)
- [Bedrock](https://roots.io/docs/bedrock/master/installation/).

## Quickstart

```bash
# Switching to the right node version (first install NVM)
nvm use
# Generate configuration and secrets
wp dotenv init --template=.env.example --with-salts --interactive
# Frontend requirements
npm install
# Backend requirements
composer install
```
## Development mode

In development mode Webpack will compile your SCSS (with autoprefixer) and JS (ES6) files and start a Browsersync server continually watching your changes. Files will also be written to `assets/dist`. The entry points are `assets/js/index.js` and `assets/scss/index.scss`.

Assuming your local WordPress installation is served at http://example.test, you can run the Browsersync server like this:

```bash
npm start -- --env.proxy example.test
```

Now the proxied site with auto-reload will be available at http://localhost:3000. The regular site without auto-reload will still be available at the original URL.

## Production mode

In production mode Webpack will compile your assets and create minified files in `assets/dist`. You can then transfer these files to the server by using FTP or `rsync`. To compile in production mode:

```bash
npm run build
```

The resulting files are generated with unique names by Webpack to get automatic cache-busting when enqueued in WordPress.

## Code style

Linting is configured in `assets/.eslintrc` (JS), `assets/.stylelintrc` (CSS), and `.php_cs.dist` (PHP). Check the files for the configuration details.

Linters can be run with:

```bash
# Frontend files
npm run lint:js
npm run lint:css

# PHP files
composer run-script lint
```
